## Binary Classification Experiment
DataSet Preprocessing.py:Initial Dataset Preprocessing.

Binary Classification Experiment (Delayed vs. Non-Delayed).py:The core of the ETDP framework comprises two components: forecasting and interpretability analysis.

Compared to deep learning algorithms.py:Performance of LSTM and CNN Models on the Dataset.

Machine Learning.py:Performance of Common Machine Learning Models on Datasets.

Component Dissolution Test:Component Meltdown Experiment for ETDP.

## Multi-classification Experiment
The file function settings are essentially consistent with the two-classification experiment.
